There will be a swimming with stingrays excursion at Grand Cayman. If the temperature is below 80 degrees, do not go in the water. There will be plenty of opportunity for pictures and videos. This excursion will be using tenders. Once the excursion is complete, go back to the tender port and return to the ship. In other words, there will be no souvenir shopping on this excursion.
