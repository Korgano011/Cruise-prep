There is a free tram ride. One of the stops will have a souvenir shop. The first ride will be for the purpose of exploring the island. When the tram ride is complete, return to the port, and do some walking. After having lunch on the ship, either use the tram, or walk to the souvenir shop, and pick up a shirt or two. Once your shopping is complete, return to the port and spend the rest of the day on the ship.
